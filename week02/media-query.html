            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>25 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness.
                I give unto men weakness that they may be humble;
                and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me;
                for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me,
                then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>

            <h2>Helaman 6:30</h2>
            <p>And behold, it is he who is the author of all sin.
                And behold, he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder,
                and doth hand down their plots, and their oaths,
                and their covenants, and their plans of awful wickedness,
                from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men.</p>
